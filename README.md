## Description 
The purpose of this project was to build a new iteration of my portflio using [React](https://react.dev/) that displays my bio, 6 of my projects, and contact information.

Program runs exclusively in browser.

Routing processed using [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

Through this project, I learnt more about Javascript, working with React, React-Router, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible. 

## Installation 
Browser with React, HTML/CSS/JS support

## Usage 
Upon loading the page, the user will be routed to Home. Using the Navbar, click on 'Projects' to view information regarding 6 of my projects, and 'Contact' to retrieve my contact information.
